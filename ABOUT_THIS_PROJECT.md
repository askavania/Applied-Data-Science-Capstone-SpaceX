# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Capstone Project

The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs throughout the course. Note that this presentation is prepared for peer-data-scientists whom are eager to understand every technical detail of the project. As such, this presentation will be much more detailed and technical than regular high-level and abstracted presentation for executive teams.
